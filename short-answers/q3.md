# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
A shadow clone is a segment of an original array.

# Teacher Feedback

A small add-on: A shallow clone only clones primitive data types which means that when we have an array inside another array, the one inside does not get its own copy and is still being referenced.
