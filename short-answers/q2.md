# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
Pass by reference means that the function's arguments are the same as the parameter. Pass by value mean that the function's arguments are made as a copy of the original value. Passes by reference are mutable.

# Teacher Feedback

Pass by reference means that the location in memory gets passed so it is mutable meaning if one instance of an array gets changed so does the original. Passed by value means that only the value gets passed in, this happens only for primitive data types.
