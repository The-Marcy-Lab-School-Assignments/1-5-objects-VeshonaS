# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
Pass by reference means that the function's arguments are the same as the parameter. Pass by value mean that the function's arguments are made as a copy of the original value. Passes by reference are mutable.
